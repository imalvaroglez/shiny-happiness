# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **Settings category manager.** Categories now use a split browser/detail editor with search, type filtering, inline subcategory creation, automatic selection of newly created categories, and confirmation dialogs for destructive category deletes.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Category repair on bootstrap.** Duplicate active categories are now canonicalized by deterministic UUID sort (lowest UUID wins). Transactions, rules, and child categories are reassigned to the canonical before soft-deleting duplicates. Repair runs after `repairStaleCategoryKinds` and before `syncRules`, and is idempotent — re-running does not create additional deletions.
- **Category display dedup.** SettingsView and CategoryPickerView defensively hide duplicate rows from display using a sorted `(parentID|kind|normalizedName)` key guard, preserving existing transaction and rule references. This is a display-only safety net; `SeedDataLoader` owns the actual repair.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Dashboard period filtering.** Overview cards and charts now share one selected period, use period-appropriate buckets, and calculate net worth as a point-in-time balance at the period end.
- **Net Worth breakdown periods.** The Net Worth drill-down now shows account balances as of the selected period's effective date, labels the balance source, and keeps its total aligned with the card and chart.
- **Net Worth breakdown copy.** Account-level balance provenance now distinguishes snapshots and reconstruction from selected-period transaction activity.
- **Dashboard chart rendering.** Period charts now use rendering-only padded domains, compact grouped Cash Flow / Charges vs Payments bars, stable bucket hover, and point-in-time balance positions so selected periods render without clipped marks, stretched gaps, or future flat lines.

### Changed

- **Development builds.** Debug builds now install as `FinanceTracker Dev` with a separate bundle identifier so manual testing does not share the production app container.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **App icon.** Added a custom macOS app icon that combines a finance card with category-chart segments.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Dashboard charts.** Spending donuts now use stable, distinct per-category colors across dashboard scopes, dim non-hovered slices, show hover/focus readouts with amount and share of total, and keep category-list rows visually linked to the active chart slice. Cash-flow and charges-vs-payments bar charts now dim inactive months, show richer hover details for net movement and savings rate, and keep tooltips fully visible near chart edges.
- **Dashboard actions.** Add Transaction, Add Balance, and Import Statement now reserve scroll space at the bottom of account dashboards so recent transaction rows and amounts remain readable.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **Settings category creation.** The "New Category" sheet now focuses the name field on open, keeps the category type selector fully interactive, enables Create only for valid input, supports Enter/Esc keyboard actions, and closes only after a successful save.
- **Backup restore safety.** The restore panel now accepts `.ftbackup` folder bundles, validates the selected bundle before attempting restore, and uses replace-all restore when recovering into an otherwise empty seeded store to avoid duplicate categories.

### Documentation

- **Production release safety.** `AGENTS.md` now documents backup-first release gates, production data isolation, migration safety rules, and blocking criteria for releases that could risk real financial data.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Card credits/bonifications.** Credit-card accounts now support `.cardCredit` flow kind for cashback rewards, statement credits, and similar positive movements that reduce owed balance without being payments. Card credits are excluded from consolidated income and cash-flow totals. `TransactionFlowKind` enum provides the six flow kinds: `income`, `expense`, `transfer`, `charge`, `cardCredit`, `payment`.
- **Payment due metadata.** `PaymentMetadataService` stores per-month payment details (due date, no-interest amount) as lightweight `Statement` rows with nil `closingBalance`. A dedicated `PaymentDetailsSheet` lets users set or update billing-month payment metadata from the liability dashboard.
- **Dashboard transaction editing.** Tapping a transaction in any dashboard opens `TransactionDetailSheet` with kind editing (charge/card credit/payment for credit cards), absolute amount editing, and category changes. `onSaved` callback refreshes the dashboard after edits.
- **Account opening dates.** Manual account creation now accepts `openedAt`, stored on `Account`. Balance roll-forward for manual-only accounts uses `openedAt` as the lower bound, excluding pre-opening transactions.
- **Payment due vs balance statement split.** `AccountBalanceResolver` now distinguishes `latestBalanceStatement` (non-nil closing balance, for interest/fees) from `latestPaymentStatement` (has payment fields, for due-date display).
- **Source statement metadata filtering.** Metadata-only statements (nil `closingBalance`, hash-prefixed) are excluded from the liability dashboard's source-statement archive summaries.

### Fixed

- **Delete All Data crash.** "Delete All Data" now removes all 9 model types in dependency-safe order (previously missed `PendingImport`, `InstallmentPlan`, and `SignRecoveryHint`), re-bootstraps seed categories and rules, and resets all UI state (sidebar, filters, sheets). `AppDataResetService` owns the deletion order as a single source of truth, used by both Settings and backup restore. Transaction category filters are now ID-based to avoid stale model references.
- **Fresh-start reset repair.** Startup repair now detects and cleans the "zero accounts but financial rows remain" state left by earlier partial resets. `resetAllData` verifies all model counts reach zero before restoring seed data, and surfaces a visible error if verification fails. Dashboard and Transactions defensively skip rendering when no accounts exist, preventing stale relationship access.
- **Hardened transaction materialization.** Transaction fetches are gated on account existence — the app never fetches `Transaction` rows when there are no accounts, preventing crashes from corrupted enum columns in orphan data. `TransactionsView` no longer uses broad `@Query<Transaction>` and fetches transactions manually only after accounts exist. Startup uses a single repair-then-configure sequence with no eager dashboard refresh before repair. Repair verifies deletion with fresh counts and escalates to a pre-container store-file quarantine under `Application Support/FinanceTracker/ResetBackups/` if SwiftData cannot clean its own store.

### Added

- **Manual accounts.** Users can now create debit, investment, credit-card, and loan accounts directly from Settings or the sidebar. Manual accounts store their creation provenance and always start with an opening balance snapshot.
- **Manual balance snapshots.** New `AccountBalanceSnapshot` model supports opening balances and later manual adjustments, letting users correct account balances without fabricating statement rows.
- **Manual transactions and transfers.** Transactions can now be added manually from the Transactions view. Paired transfers create linked source/destination transactions with a shared `transferGroupID` and consistent asset/liability signs.
- **Hybrid balance resolver.** Account dashboards now resolve balances from the latest imported statement or manual balance snapshot, then roll forward only later non-deleted, non-duplicate transactions.
- **Loan account support.** `AccountType.loan` routes through liability dashboards with loan-specific copy and hides credit-card-only payment due, utilization, source statement, and installment sections.
- **Source file tracking.** `Statement` now stores `sourceFileName` and `sourceArchivedPath` alongside the existing hash. Imported files are archived with content-addressed names (`<hash-prefix>_<original-name>.pdf`) to prevent same-name overwrites. Liability dashboards show a "Source Statements" section listing each statement's file name, period, import date, and metadata completeness status.
- **Category repair on bootstrap.** `SeedDataLoader` now repairs stale `Credit Card Payments` categories that were created with `kind = .transfer` in older stores. Repairs kind to `.creditCardPayment`, promotes to top-level, deduplicates if both old and new categories exist, and reassigns transactions/rules to the canonical.
- **Payment due card states.** The credit-card payment-due card now distinguishes "no statement" from "statement exists but due date unavailable" from "due date present but payment amounts missing." Missing amounts show "Unavailable" instead of hiding the row.

- **Settings: Account deletion.** Per-account destructive delete with confirmation alert showing data counts. `AccountDeletionService` manually cascades through statements, transactions, pending imports, and installment plans (all Account relationships use `.nullify` delete rules). Dashboard receives an `onAccountDeleted` callback that resets sidebar selection to Overview.
- **Settings: Category manager.** Inline "Categories" section grouped by `CategoryKind`, with add parent, add subcategory, and delete actions. `CategoryManagementActions` service handles validation (empty/duplicate names), subcategory→parent reassignment on delete, and parent-deletion blocking when children exist.
- **Category soft-delete.** `Category.deletedAt: Date?` for soft-delete. Categorizer, `IngestPipeline`, and `SeedDataLoader` all filter out rules pointing to nil or soft-deleted categories. `@Query<Category>` in picker and transactions view filters to active only. Seed bootstrap treats soft-deleted names as "exists" to prevent recreation.
- **Backup compatibility.** `CategorySnapshot.deletedAt` round-trips through backup export/restore. Optional field decodes as `nil` from old backups.
- **Per-account dashboards.** `DashboardScope` (`.consolidated | .account(UUID)`) dispatches to purpose-built `AssetAccountDashboard` (checking/savings) or `LiabilityAccountDashboard` (credit cards). Sidebar lists accounts with type-appropriate icons.
- **Interactive charts and drill-downs.** Hover tooltips on time-series charts. `BreakdownSheet` drills into every aggregate (income, expenses, interest, net worth, category spending) showing the rows behind each number.
- **Account display name.** `Account.displayName` prefers nickname, then `"<institution> ····<last4>"`, then institution name. Per-account editor in Settings: nickname, identity color, credit limit.
- **Data safety.** `lastModifiedAt` on all 8 `@Model` classes. `Transaction.deletedAt` soft-delete with "Recently Deleted" toggle. `.ftbackup` folder-bundle export/restore with `mergeKeepingNewer` and `replaceAll` strategies. Automatic backup scheduler (daily/weekly/monthly pruning).
- **Learning hooks.** `LearningHooks.recordCategorization` and `.recordSignRecovery` create idempotent rules from user corrections. Sign-recovery hints improve future paste-import accuracy.
- **HSBC 2Now paste import.** `PasteImportSheet` with live detection chip. `PastedHsbc2NowParser` extracts statement header, MSI table, and per-card transaction sections. Multi-HSBC account isolation via `sectionNumber`.
- **Editable transactions.** Inline date/description/amount editing via popover. `PendingReviewSection` for resolving parser ambiguities.
- **Transaction category editing.** Tap any row to open category picker → apply-to-similar flow. User corrections create `CategoryRule` with `source: "user_correction"`.
- **SPEI destination-specific categorization.** Rules for 8 destinations (Priority, 2now, Nu, TDC Explora, INVEX Volaris, BBVA 2855, Explora/BANAMEX, Moneypool). Unknown destinations fall to Uncategorized.
- **Custom date range picker.** From/To DatePickers for arbitrary dashboard periods.
- **Multi-account PDF parsing.** `StructuralParser.parseSections` detects account boundaries in multi-section PDFs (e.g., Openbank Débito + Apartados). Separate Account + Statement per section.
- **Net worth from statement balances.** `computeNetWorth` sums latest `closingBalance` per account. Time series anchored to actual statement data.
- **Structural parser.** Knowledge-driven PDF parsing: `ColumnDetector`, `SemanticNormalizer`, `LayoutFingerprint`/`LayoutStore`. Supports Openbank, Amex, Banorte, Suburbia, DiDi, CETES, Skandia.
- **Liquid Glass UI.** All opaque backgrounds replaced with `.glassEffect` materials. `MeshGradient` background for glass refraction.

### Changed

- **Manual transaction category picker.** Manual transaction creation now uses the same grouped category picker as transaction editing, filtered to income categories for income and expense categories for expenses/charges.
- **Import account matching protects manual accounts.** Imported statements attach to manually created accounts only when account/card numbers match. Numberless imports no longer attach to manual accounts by loose institution/type matching.
- **Liability payment computation is sign-based.** Credit-card dashboard totals and charges-vs-payments chart no longer exclude transactions by category kind. Positive amounts count as payments/credits regardless of whether categorized as transfer, credit-card payment, refund, or uncategorized. Consolidated cash flow still excludes both `.transfer` and `.creditCardPayment`.
- **Charges vs Payments chart legend.** Added explicit color-coded legend (Charges red, Payments & Credits green). Relabeled "Payments" to "Payments & Credits" in tooltip and totals.
- **Amex metadata extraction uses statement-summary semantics.** Gold Elite statements now parse the arithmetic summary row and credit summary directly. `closingBalance` represents total outstanding debt from credit limit minus available credit, while `paymentForNoInterest` stores the statement balance / saldo a pagar.
- **Transactions filter bar.** Account, category, and recently-deleted controls now live behind a compact Filters popover with active filter chips. Sorting is a separate icon menu without the extra "Sort" label.
- **Transactions list loading.** Transaction list data loading is now guarded/manual to avoid materializing orphaned corrupted transaction rows.

- **Credit-card dashboard: removed Interest & Fees card.** Statement metadata preserved in snapshot/model; visual card removed for all credit-card types.
- **Category picker: removed inline creation.** Replaced with passive "Manage categories in Settings" hint. Creation now lives in the Settings category manager.
- **Spending donut uses vivid per-category colors.** Explicit color map (Food=orange, Transport=blue, etc.) replaces hash-based assignment.
- **Dashboard excludes all transfer/cash-flow categories.** Uses `category?.kind` to exclude `.transfer` and `.creditCardPayment` from income/expense aggregates.
- **Apply to Similar: review before applying.** Scrollable list of matching transactions with per-row checkboxes instead of simple count+confirm.
- **TransactionsView: native Table layout.** 4-column sortable Table replacing list view. Full `descriptionRaw` displayed.
- **GlassCard hover performance.** Static 35° stroke fading in on hover replaces `.repeatForever` rotation.
- **Drill-down completeness.** Snapshots carry full filtered transaction set (removed `prefix(20)` cap).
- **SeedDataLoader incremental sync.** Compares JSON subcategory names and rule patterns against existing DB, inserts only missing entries.

### Fixed

- **SwiftData invalidated account crash.** Dashboard account snapshots and account deletion confirmation state now capture value identities instead of retaining live `Account` models after deletion. Dashboard startup also avoids stale account/category relationship reads that could trap when SwiftData invalidates backing rows.
- **Credit-card payments hidden from liability dashboard.** Transfer-kind credit-card payments (e.g., Explora "Credit Card Payments" with kind `.transfer`) now appear in liability payment totals and charges-vs-payments chart. Root cause: category-kind filter excluded `.transfer` from liability aggregates.
- **Amex Gold Elite utilization understated.** Gold Elite no longer treats the previous payment amount as the statement balance. Re-importing the same PDF repairs stale non-nil metadata without duplicating transactions.
- **Amex Gold Elite due-date not parsed.** Date format `dd de MMMM yyyy` (e.g., "31 de Marzo 2026" without second "de") now parses correctly. Added regex alternative and DateFormatter entry.
- **Pago Mínimo collision with installments line.** Exact-colon parsing prevents "Pago mínimo mas meses sin intereses" from overriding the actual "Pago Mínimo" value.

- **Deduplicator requires exact same day.** Changed `abs(daysDiff) <= 1` to `daysDiff == 0`.
- **Category picker shows subcategories.** Switched from `cat.subcategories` (unreliably materialized) to filtering `@Query` results.
- **REGRESSION: SwiftData schema migration failure.** `CategoryRule` `matchCount` default caused store fallback to empty. Deleted incompatible store; fresh database created on next launch.
- **Volaris INVEX rule corrected.** SPEI to INVEX Volaris is a credit card payment, not a flight purchase.
- **Account deduplication.** `findOrCreateAccount` falls back to institution+type matching when account number doesn't match.
- **Category picker save flow.** Category saved immediately on selection; "Apply to Similar" presents after first sheet dismisses.
- **Interest earned $0.00 fix.** Removed `^...$` anchors from "Abono de intereses" rule.
- **Apartado deposit parsing.** Interest, ISR, and deposits now extracted from wide-header table cells with inline amounts.
- **Dashboard shows data on first import.** Date range changed from hardcoded 2020 start to `Date.distantPast`; default period changed to `.all`.
- **Import sheet dismiss.** Added Done button to paste-import sheet opened from floating button.
- **SeedDataLoader crash.** Replaced `Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:)` with safe loop for duplicate category names.

### Removed

- **Interest & Fees card** from credit-card dashboards (data preserved in model).
- **Inline category creation** from `CategoryPickerView` (moved to Settings).
- All NSLog diagnostic calls from `StructuralParser` and `IngestPipeline`.

### Architectural decisions

- **AD-009..AD-014** Manual-review-first parser, signed liability balances, supplementary-card model, MSI handling, credit-card payment classification, learning hooks.
- **AD-015..AD-018** `Transaction.deletedAt` soft-delete, local `.ftbackup` bundles, `findOrCreateAccount` section-number isolation, deduplicator behavior with soft-deleted rows.
- **AD-019..AD-021** Account deletion as permanent purge with manual cascade, category soft-delete preventing seed recreation, categorizer rejection of nil/deleted-category rules.
